# Reason For Designing Application:
This project was done for a group project at Wilfrid Laurier for CP469 (iPhone Application Programming).
We were tasked to create an application using XCode.

# How To Run:
You need to have XCode to run this application.

# Features
Incorporated:
- Calendar View (Yearly/Monthly/Daily) -> Can add events into the calendar and they will show in Monthly and Daily Views
- Notes View -> Can add/delete/edit notes and they are persistent
- Weather View -> Shows the weather in Waterloo in real time

# Project Deliverables:
1. Idea Presented to Professor
2. Video demo of application and its functionality

# Project Benefits:
- Experience with XCode, Swift and StoryBoard

# Project Risks: 
1. Technical difficulties with the UI
2. This is our first iPhone app, and the team lacks expertise

# Participation Record (% of effort):
